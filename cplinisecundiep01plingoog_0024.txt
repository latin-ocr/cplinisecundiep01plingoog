not a case of haphazard survival, nor yet of posthumous
editing by a stranger. We have the satisfaction of knowing
that the collection contains just what the writer intended
it should. We are not troubled with misgivings, therefore,
in forming our estimato of him. As he tells his own story,
we may take him at his word. It is eminently fitting that
suche man,and the representative oi such an age, should
appear before the world in a literary toilet thus care-
fully arranged. Letters which showed him ea
aestatim, so to speak, or betrayed him at an
unguarded moment, when he forgot his pose, if hc ever had¹
such a moment, would be out of keeping. Pliny in a state
-of nature would not be the real Pliny. He is least artificial
in the letters to Trajan, but he is not there at his best.
We appreciate his abilities and his conscientious endeavors
as an administrator. But he is ont of his element at such
a post as the governorship of a troublesomc province. No
doubt he was proud toube trusted, but the position clearly
worried him, and in his beart he pined for the brilliant
society of Rome or the calm literary reposo of his villas.
Pliny's chief excellence as a writer is his cleorness, and
the chief clement of his oharrn is hirsowecensem thought
and expression. One evidence of this isthe
singular felicity of Melmoth’s translation in g⁰ggffi¹t¹⁶⁸⁸
‘J ohnsonese.' Warton said of this version that
it bettered the original. While we might not be willing to
go so far as that, we do feel that the extraordinary appro
¹priateness of its eighteenth century English to the Latin of
the original letters stamps Pliny as in many respects a
kindrcd spirit with the English authors of that time.
’ To sum up our impressions,—Pliny is the most amiable
of the ancient writers. Not only is headmir-
able in all private relations, but nothing unhind
is said by him of any contemporaries whiile they humerosus
