Another important contribution 10 the subiect is that 01 0. Peter
(Zur Obroncloyt'c der Brt'esc dcc jiiuycreu Plv'nt'us, Philologus, XXXII.
698 sqq.).

Peter criticIses Mommsen’s view 11101 11 10 always true that letters
whose dates can be fixed fit Into the chronological order and that the
others are not inconsistent with it, and especially the opinion that no '
letters were written before the death 01 Domitian. He thinks but
little weight is to be attached to the fact that wherever two letters
have 0 connection the later one always stands later in the collection,
that letters about the same subjector 01 the same period come in the
same book or in two consecutive books. In the same light he regards
the argument of Mommsen about the age of the correspondents, ob-
serving that most correspondents get but a single letter.

Tben follow the positive inferences which Peter draws. In the letters
of the 4th and oth books Pliny appears as a poet, and a lyric poet at
that. But in Ep. vl1.4 he says that he has acceptionum made an
essay In hendecasyllabics‚ while In Ep. VIII. 21 he calls the collection
cf his poems musteus liber, and In Ep. IX. 34 hImself a novus pocta.
Hence these letters must have been written earher than those in books
land 5.

He finds that Epp. IV. 3, IV. 18, and V. 15, to Arrius Antonius

are not in the right crder3 also that the same is true 01 Epp. VlIl. 1
and IX. 34, and 01 Epp. Il. 11, H. 123 compared with Epp. 111.4,
III. 9. .

, With reference to Ep. Il. 9, he argues that it dIsproves the idea
that the letters 01 the ad book go only to the beginning 01 199, on
0000011101 chronological consideratione, which, he states, render it
impossible that Erucius should have been a candidate 101 the tribune·
ship in 109.

The most 0010101 0110011011 10 devoted to the date of the 11101 01
Classicus, which Mommsen places In 101, forgetting‚ as Peter claime,
the fact that the case of Marius (Ep. 11. 11) was twice under discus
sion, — once about May, 99, and again in J anumy, 100. The decision
on the first occasion was that civil proc'eedings should go on first, and
meantime codefendants and witnesses for the criminal proceedings
should be brought from the province. Peter's opinion is 00 follows:

, The trial 01 Classicus Is to be dated in September, 99, 101

1. Βο111 Μο1100 Ρ110000 and Classicus governed provinces in the
same year.

2. Mommsen 10 obliged to assume thatYliny was procinetus 0000011
