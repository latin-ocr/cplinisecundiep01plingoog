historical oriting supfmsedly peculiar to text-books, Professor
Andrews has trade no effort to find it. His aim has been to tull
the story simply and clearly. lating out nothing that ought to be
known. and including nothing that seemed to be unnecessary.
furtherrnore, he has had constantii· in mind matters of proportiom
perspectire. and the proper arrangement os material, and has
made a narrative that nill stand the test of scholarship.

The apparatus of this book oonsists of a large number of maps
and genealogioel tables. a mrefully selected list of books that
would be usesul in any school library. a detailed chronological
table, sootnote references to source books, and bibliographies of
the best and most recent works os an authoritatire character

raphies and footnotes are for the teacher: the footnotes to oell
attention to critical questions and problems in English history3
the bibliographies to furnish a comprehensive list os the best
boolo, with a brief commentary.

The illustrations, screnty-four in number, are not mere embel·

lishment5‚ but serve really to illustrate the text. A fac-simile oi
ascetion of Magna Charta, reproductions of drawings in early
manuscripts, and pictores of a similar character, add to the pupil's

interest iu the story oi Englanh.
