seriously ill,l so that if they died, they might die free and ·
dispose by'will of their small possessions. Comum was not
the only place benefited by his liberality, for he built aud
dedicated a temple at Tifernum,² and restored a temple of
Ceres on one of his estates, providing it with colonnades to

All this munificence implies wealth. Pliny was rich, but
not extremely so. He sometimes had to com-
plain of hard times or of poor vintages, and to
hesitate about a desired purchase⁴ We know
that he had estates from both his father and his mother,⁵ and
he must have inherited something from his uncle. Two of
his villas, which overlooked the Lake of Como,
he playfully called Tragedy and Comedy.⁶ His m?
Tuscan estatc,⁷ near Tifernum and the Apen-
nines, yielded an income of 400‚000 sesterces.⁸ Besides
country houses at Tusculum,⁹Tibur, andPraencstc,¹⁰ he owned
a splendid villa on the scashore at Laurentum, seventcen
miles from Rome. This was evidently a favorite with him,
for one of the longest of the letters gives an elaborate
description of it.¹l

Like most literary men who make a large figure in town,-
always excepting Charles Lamb and Dr. Samuel
Johnson,-Pliny is forever sighing for the
country. Just how much of such sighing is
genuine and how much is conventional is hard to determine.
