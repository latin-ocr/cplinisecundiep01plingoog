xxxviii mrsonucrron. 11

o. Fondness for pairs of nearly synonyrnous words:

picria famaque . . . adsensio et luae, ιν. 12. 6.
’ oetas et anticam, 111. 6. 3.

Sometimes three such words are grouped:

crore, tortori, iubere, vr. 20. 12.

p. Informal personification‚ by the use, in reference to
inanimata objeots, of words which properly apply to living
beings‚ is characteristic of the age. -

The poetic coloring of the prose of the Silver Age was
not altogether the result of a conscious process. The lan-
guage oi the great classic poets had become a part of ursiver-
sal expression, and was used, in great part, unconsoiously
by all writers.

q. There are rather too many proverbs‚ ioci commanos,
sententious phrases which tend sometimes to produce the
impression of banality.

aratia melorum tam inflia catecumina, 1. 5. 16.
ratio quoe sapientibus pro necessitate est, r. 12. 3.
perit aratia si reposcatur, 1. 13. 6.

N ec doctum satis et parum severum,
Sed non rusticulum nimis libellum
Facundo mea Plinio Thalia

I perfer: brevis et labor peractae
Altum vincere tramitem Suburae.

illic Orphea protinus videbis

Udi vertice lubricum theatri
Mirantesque feras avemque regis
Raptum quae Phryga pertulit Tonanti3
