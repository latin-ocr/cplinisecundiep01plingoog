THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE LETTERS

Jon. Messon publishcd at Amsterda11r‚in1709‚his Plinii Secundi
Inniorr's uita ordine chronologicam dr'gesta nt creria dilucidentur
historiae Romanae promta quac Flauianos Imperatores uti Nervam
et Traianum spectant. (Prefixed to Arntzen's edition 01 the Pane-
gyric‚ Amst. 1738.)

The most important contribution in recent times to this subject is
Mommsen's article in Hermes, 111. pp. 31-139, Zur Leheasceschichte
des jiingerea Plinius. , .

Mommsen minimizes the significancc of the phrase in Ep. 1. 1, oca
seruato temporis ordine, and concludes that upon the whole, though
not in every particular, the arrangement 01 the letters is chronological,
and also that Pliny himself issued all nine books at successive dates,
The latter point may be inferred not merely from the well known
practice of publishing literary works in instalnrents, bnt also from
Ep. IX. 19, significas lenisse te ia quadam epistula raca, referring to
Ep. VI. 10, and from Ep. VII. 28, addressed to the same person .
as Ep. 1. 1, justifying the author's praising of his friends. Mommsen
argues that letters on the same subject, or otherwise evidently synchrn
nous, are found'in the same book or in consecutive books, and con-
versely that two certainly synchronous letters are never far separated,
and that of a pair of letters the later one never comes first in the col-
lection. A similar chronological order is traced in the references to

¹ certain persons, e.g., M. Regulus and Calestrius Tiro, in the references

change is observed in the list of Pliny’s correspondente„ older men
