charges with reflecting on the emperor by the request which he had ,
made. Massa was a notorious favorite oi Domitian. Note the new
sense oi impietas, disloyalty to the person oi the emperor, aequired
in tha imperial age. Horror omnium: sc. snit

2. clarissimi: this adjective was becoming stereotypud3 in the
later empire, it is the technical designation of a certain cluss in the
civil hierarchy. It is here the title oi a consul; in Ep. IX. 13, 19, oi
aconsular.

3. ne mihi . . . obiecerit: chatholica eaposed mc to the suspicion
os callusr'oa. Whatever derivation we assume, praevaricatio is ‘orook-
edness,’ especially that of an advocate who betrays his client through
an understanding with the opposite party. Pliny uses the word also
·in Epp. Ι. 20. 2, and ΙΙΙ. 9. 34.

6. Divus: deiyied. Very bad emperors, eg, Nero, Domitian, do
not enjoy this posthumous title in history. Nerva: he spent some
time in exile under Domitian. privatus quoque: i.e., before he
became emperor. attendebat: asad to talea aa interest ia.

9. simile antiquis: this phrase in Pliny is complimentary3 ci.
Epp. IV. 3. 13 V. 14. 3.

11. non exlgo ut excedas: the sentence seems to imply a good
deal, lndireotly, as to the manner in which history was ‘colored'
But this demand is decidedly more modest than Cicero's in tho letter
already cited. Pliny is a smaller man than his exemplar, even in
vanity.

13. egredi: the use oi this verb with the accusative is mainly
post-classiani, but it is found in Caesar and Sallust ; cf. page 87, line 6.
honeste faetta veritas sufficit: oi. the remark oi Verginius to Clu·
vius, page 113, lines 20-22.
