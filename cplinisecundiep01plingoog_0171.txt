Pago 3. Latiar 4. This letter appearstohare been written after
Jauuary 1, 97, but before the death of Nerva. An account of (C. Li-
cinius) Voconius Romanus (cf. ΟΜ. ll. saudauma) is given iu
Ep. Il. 13. From this letter, and from ad Trai. 4, it appears that he
was Pliny’s follow-student and comrade in arms, that he was an ad-
vocate, a flamen of llither Spain (see note on Ep. Il. 13. 4), that Pliny
obtained for him the ius trium liberorum from Nerva, and the latus
clavus from Trajan. Epp. Ι. b; III. 13 are addressed to Voconius
Romanus ; Epp. II. l; VI. 15; VI. 33 ; VIII. 83 IX. l; IX. 28
to Romanus. Demogeot (Ptine lc Jenua Lettres Ohoist'es) says that
Romanus became a friend of Hadrian, who composed his epitaph:
Motibus versu, merite peditus erut.

1. Μ. Regulo: M. Aquilius Regulus rose to great wealth and
power under Nero by ‘delation’ Accused at the beginning oi Vespa-
sian’s telgn‚ he was defended in the senate by his half-brother, the
eloquent L. Vipstanus Messalla. Tac. Hist. IV. 42. 'ibe charges
against him detailed by Tacitus tend to confirm our belief in the iust-
ness of Pliny’s opinion. Martial’s effusive compliments to Regulus,
Epig. I. 12 ; 82 ; 111; IV. 16, count ior nothing as testimonials to his
character. He stands almost alone as an obJ'ect of open scorn and
detestation to Pliny, who is nearly always mild and charitable in his
J'udgments. Pliny tells three scandalous stories about him, Ep. II. 20 ;
describes his tasteless and hypocritical momning athis son's death,
Ep. IV. 7 ; but after his death mourns his loss to the legal profession,
Ep. VI. 2. timidiorem humiliorem: Regulus feared punishment
ior his crimes, after the death oi his patron Domitian. But in dealing
with informem, as in many other respons, the govcrument of Nerva
showed itsclf moderate, not to say feeble. Observe the asyndeton;
this is a noticeable feature of Pliny’s style, but the same may bo said

. of many authors who labor much after striking effeots.

3. tectiore: the free comparison of participial adiectives, which
marks the Silver Age of Latin, is already noticeable in Livy.

5. Rustici Aruleni: L. Iunius Arulenus Rusticus‚aStoic‚pupilof
Paetus Thrasea, was put to death in nn. 93 for writing a panegyric
on Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus, the bools was publioly burued3 cf.
