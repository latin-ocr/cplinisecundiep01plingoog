PLINY'S samo

The style of Pliny may bo generally characterized by
two statements which at first seem inconsistent. He was
undoubtedly an imitator-of Cicero, and at the same time
he was a true representative of the Silver Age.

In his smooth, copious fluency he is like his avowed
master and model, Cicero: in his diction, his forms of ex-
pression, his syntax, he shows a striking affinity with the
chief prose writers of his own time, Quintilian, his toacher,
and Tacitus, his friend.

Compared with the men of his own generation, he is freer
than any from the peculiar faults of the Latinity of the
time, and exhibite the least departure from the language in
its strictly classical forms. Yet no man can escape the
influcnce of his age and environment, and it is therefore
only natural that even in Pliny we find many neologismS,
many words the sense of which has been altered, many
poetic expressions transferred to prose, many rare and far·
fetched constructione, over-frequent figures of speech, and,
in general, a style marked by somewhat excessive antithesis
and not free from artificia] conceits. And yet it is, withal,
a good style, always interesting, sometimes beautiful, here
and there exhibiting a nervous vigor worthy cf Tacitus.

Following are some of the features of Pliny's diction and
style, which, though not necessarily peculiar to him, may

’ be fairly regarded as characteristic. The examples under
each head are to bc taken merely as illustratiremet' asan

exhaustiwe list. N o examples hare heau gisen wuido ho
