YomgPliny was so fortunate, moreover‚ as to have for bis
guardian¹ no less a man than Verginius Rufus ni ,
whose 'importance is sufficiently indicated by the magadan
fact that he thrice refused the imperial purple.

With two such sponsors, it is not surprising that our
Pliny's career in politius, at the bar, and in literature should
have begun early. His own ability, reinforced by hard
work, enabled him to grasp the success which rare socia]
and educatione] advantages put within his reach.

Great pains were taken with his bringing up. The condi-
tions of life among the Romans were then such
that almost the only way to practical success
was the career cf the orator. Hence the education of a

gentleman was intended to train him to be an effective public

screatus

speaker, and ‘ rhetoric' was synonymous with a liberal edu-
cation, general as wel] as special. Cato’s definition-

Orctor cst vir bonus dicendi peritus,2 ,

- well expressed the Roman ideal oi an earlier age. The
most complete exposition of the system of education in
vogue in the first century is found in the great work of
Quintilian, the Institutio Oratortu. Quintilian was one of
Pliny's teachers3-tbat schoolmaster who be·

came consul, and whose career shows the esteem mm

in which ‘ rhetoric' then stood. Another was the celebrated >

Nicetes Sacerdos from Smyrna.⁴
It may have been at this period that Pliny’s life-long

friendship with Tacitus began. The only event in this early
part oi his life oi which we hare detailed knowledge is the
memorable eruption of Vesuvius in i 9 sn, when
he was in his eighteenth year. The story is
told in two letters to Tacitus.⁵ One of them
