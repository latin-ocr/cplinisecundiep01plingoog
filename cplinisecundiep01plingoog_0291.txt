Poppaeo, nn. 9). Hardy's note gives'a convenient enumeration of ¹
tbe privileges attached to tlre ius trium liberorum: (l) inheritance of

κ legacies left to caelibes, which the latter were forbidden to take (cu-
ducu) ; (2) preference in petendis honoribus ,· (3) holding offiees before
the legal age or without the legal interval ; (4) preference in the
assignment of provinces ; (5) precedente before equale and colleagues;
(6) exemption from the duties of tutor and iudex,· (7) mitigation oi
punishment iu certain cases. Wise emperors granted the ius trium
liberorum sparingly, others more freely, to childless persons. The
grant was strictly persensi, and did not benefit the heire of the persons
concerned, nor was itin any way assiguable.

10. Iull Serviani : brother-in-law of Hadrian, born about anfi.
He held many important official positions‚ and was one of the persons
mentioued in the will of llasumius, already referred to ; see intro-
ductory note to Ep. ΙΙ. 6. For details see Mommsen in Keil’s Pliny.
At the time of this letter he was legate of Upper Germany. Pliny
addressed him in llpp. Ill. 17 and VI. 26.

Pag6122. 1. rescripto: a rescriptum, sometimes called epie-
tulu, was the technical name for the emperor's official reply toa
petition orto the inquiry of a magistrate asking for instructioneor
advice.

2. summam voti: tlrelteiylttofmydesiree. ’-

4. peculiarem: personui.

5. illo tristissimo saeculo: Domitian's reign.

6. duobus matrimoniis: this evidently means two marriages in

” Domitian's reign. On the other hand, the letters about Calpurnia
seem ιο refer to a recent marriage, and are evidently to be dated well
on in Trajan's reign. Hence we infer that Calpurnia was the third
wife of Pliny ; see Introduction, page xviii. ’

8. patrem fieri: i.e.‚ obtain tlre privileges of a father, become a
pater in the eye of the lavv. With the general sentiment of this sen-
tence, cf. Puuep. 26, Super orrtnia est tumen quod tulis es, ut sub te
liberos tollere libeat, expediat.

Letter 103. This and the following letters were written from
Pliuy's province, Pontus and Bithynia; see Introduction, page xviii.
11. eocrui meae: Pompeia Celerina, mother of Pliny’s second
wife, who had died in nn. 97, as we may infer with strong probability

from Ep. IX. 13. 4 and tt. Coneermugllompeia,see Epp. 1,4; 111,
h 19.8,· VI. 10.1; and notes. ἱ
12. iu hene provinciam: Bithynia.
