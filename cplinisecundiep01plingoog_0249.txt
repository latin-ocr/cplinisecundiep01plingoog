11. rationes: accounts. This extreme distaste ior businesS, which
is scarcely in tlte manner oi the fine llornans oi the old school, is
simply one oi l'liny's hariuless affectatione, supposed ιο be becoming in

12. mittatue: devoted. coeperam etiem: this is a striking

... atrdiebam . . . legebam . . . coeperam ctiam, seven verbs without et
or aue, the last iollowed by etiam. In Ep. VL 6. 9, e.g., we bave
hoc tempas acerna, hoc fides, hoc etiam diatriton. Numerous examplee
will be readily observed oi this peculim iorm oi asyndeton, the last
member oi the connected series oi words or phrases being followed
by etiam; ci. inter alia, page 20, line 22, and note. See Introduc-
tion, ᾗ 6. α.
