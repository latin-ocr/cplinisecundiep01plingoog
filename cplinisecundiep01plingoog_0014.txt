positione open to consulars alone.l By way of preliminary ·

qualifications the young aspirant to the curcua frenorum
was required to fill one of the minor annual magistracies,
collectively called the Vigintivirate,² and to serve at least a
nominal term in the army as tribunus rnilitum laticlaviam,
ostensibly as uide on the staff of some governor of a province
who commanded troops. Hence we often hear of the senten
stris militia of a tribunus honores petiturus. Pliny was Xcir
stlitibus iudicantis? in 81 or 82. His military tribuneship
was spent in Syria‚⁴ where he was attached to the third
legion, ‘ Gallica‚’ and employed in clerica] work connected
with the accounts of the army.⁵ At this time he must have
been twenty or a little older. After returning to Rome, he
obtained the quaestorship, the lowest senatorial
office. As the minimum age for this was twenty-
five,⁶ he cannot have held it before 87. It seems most
probable that his term was from J uly 1, 89, to June 30, 90.
The fact that he was quaestor Caesarie indicates that he was
in high favor with the emperor Domitian at this time. The
lea annulis, which fixed the age at which each office might
be held, also required an interval of at least a year between
the first and second, and between the second and third,
and of two years between the third and fourth offices. We
know that Pliny was praetor in 93.7 Meantime
he had been tribune of the plebe,⁸ probably from
Dec. 10, 91, to Dec. 9, 923 the year's interval between trib
