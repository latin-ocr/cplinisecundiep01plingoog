In these volumes each poem is preceded by a careful analysis
giving in a line or two all necessary information regarding the
subject, date, and mette. Each volume is prefaced by a scholarly
discussion of the lise and work of Horace, his metres, and lan·
guage. The commentary is concise, accurate, and eminently
judicious, in all cases telling the student all he needs to know,
and never telling him more than he needs, or more than he will
understand and appreciate.
