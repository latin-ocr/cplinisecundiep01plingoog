This is the great inscription which was graved on the wall of the Thermae
which Pliny gave to Comum- The marble slab was broken into six pieces,
of which four were built into a tomb in St- Ambrose's Churcli- These four
subsequently disappeared, and only the first one has been rediscovered- By
its aid and that of written records Mommsen reproduced the whole inscription.
