HIS book is in complete harmony with the report ot' the
Committee of Seven of the National Historical Association.
lt deals with the Eastern nations and with the Greeks, Romans,
and Teutons, the elemeuts from which the modern world has
grown. lts aim is to show the continuity of history. Little space
'is given to legends, or to anecdotos, or to wars3 attention is
directed to the growth of society, to the development of institu-
tions, to the fusion of peoplcs.
The book is accepted as marking a new epoch in the study of
History in this country.

Professor C. W. Δ. Veditz, Butes College, Lewisfon, Maine .· I like the book
because it does not waste any time over the mere curiosities of history.
l like it because it puts wars into the background and institutions into the
loreground. I like it because it iswell balanced; because it breaks away
from traditions‚ where traditions have had nothing but age to recommend
them: because it omits the ephemeral and accidental incidents, and
empltasizes the tasting influences of ancient history: because it contains
frequent, well-chosen quotations from the best authorities, and thus
inspires a desire to read further.

Principal H. P. ll. arren, Albany Academy, Albany, N.l'..· 1 have read it

froin cover to cover with critical interest. The book is remarkable for '

breadth ol scholarship and skill in treatment. How a man can cover so
much ground, and with proper emphasis. in 500 pages‚is beyond my ken.
alt facts relating to a nation are always before him, and he marshals
them as a great general arrangcs a great army.

Professor George S. Goodspeed, Universtty of Chicago, Chicaga 111..-

History is more than mere aunals3 it is the rarer thing-historica} inter-
pretation, a chapter out of the evolution of human progress. Wisely

emphasizes the broadly humamthe economic. the social. lts abundance
