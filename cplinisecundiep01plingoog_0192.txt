by the adverb septos, in Ep. ll. ll. 17. The conclusion of the Agricola
proves how eloquent Tacitus may have been on this occasion.

4. plenus anuis: this is a finer phrase than Virgil's, Aen. Vll. 53,
plenis unitis ,· plenos in the best authors is usually constructed with the
genitive, but the ablativo is frequent and is found even in Cicero.

appears to have been nominated in this way by Frontinus, to whose
place he sucoeeded in the augural college, probably nn. 103.

reorganize the public finances and retrench expensos aiter the extrava-
