Ep. 23 cannot have been written before 108 or 109 ii Avitus is the
one mentioned in the testament 01 Dasumius.

Boon IX.

This is the poorest 01 all in dates. Possibly VIII. and IX. were

issued together ; all we can be sure 01 10 that they were not issued
before 108 or 109.

Mommsen points out the important datum 101 this series. Pliny
mentions several times a Calpurnius Macer, a contemporary governor,
his nearest neighbor, a commender 01 legions. His provInce must
have been Lower Moesia (c.1.L. 111. 777). Consideration 01 this and ·
other known 10010 leads Mommsen to date the 1000110 from 111,
September, to 113, January.

H. F. Stobbe (an Ultroneloyie der Blaeso des Plinius, Philologus,
XXX. 347-393) embodies the results 01 his own investigation, which ⁴
was independent' 01 Mommsen’s. The conclusions which he reaches
010 somewhat different.

Pliny undertook the case in the autumn 01 99, while that 01 Ρ1100110
