Ιι. Ellipsis. In the extent of his use of this figure
Pliny hardly exoeeds Cicero (in his letters) and Tacitus.

1. The most common form is the omission oi forms
of the verb ‘to be! Pliny is peculiar in not oon-
fining ellipsis to est, sunt, and esse, but in extending
it to other moods, other tenses, and other persons

2. His omission of aerbo dicendi, neovmdi, mendi,
ete, is not peculias. It tende to brevity, and
they are easily supplied.

3. Sometimes there is a continuous effort‚to secure
brevity. An example of this is the whole of Ep. 1.5.

i. Similes are frequent.

j. Conoinnity is elaborate, antithesis is constantly aimed
ai.

lc. Oxymoron:

morti. . . immortalem plemam, v1.16.1.
sempervicturus occiderit, v1. 16. 2.
pereminens inter aaa, 111. 19. 4.

l. Assonanoe:

⁴secere scribendo aet sambore lependm vi. 16. 3.

m. Repetition of a word with change of form:

ratio rationem . . . timorem timor, v1. 16. 16.
messiliam exsiliicomam, vn. 19. 6.

n. Repetition of a word in the same form:

de aito eius . . . de aito poem, ιν. 7. 2.
ia praefectura . . . saie, soit et ia consolato, v. 14. 5.

But there is evident oare not to repeat a nond too oiten
in quini< succession. Note, los instante, 'm mmmm-*o

audii, tlie variety of words ion ‘prospest‘
