· uneship and praetorship had been remitted by Domitian.l
He explains in Ep. I. 23 and in Panegyric 95 his reasons for
reiraining from practice as an advocate during the year of
his tribuneship. He claims credit also for modestia during
his praetorship. Certainly such conduct was prudent. That
it was not safe, in 93, to make one's seli conspicuous in

any way is evident from Tacitus’s account of the death oi
Agricola² in that year. Pliny was so disoreet that he was
as late as 940195, appointed praefectus 1111111111
σθωθῆἰῗω militaris, an office which he held for three
of the military .
cm, years. Nevertheless, rt appeared from papers
found in Domitian's desk, after his murder,
that Pliny would, in all probability, soon have been added
to the list of the tyrant’s victims³ Fortunately, however, he
was allowed to live on into the better times of Nerva and
Trajan. Yet his advanoement, which had been steady and
rapid, partly perhaps owing to the support of
⁰⁰¹²¹¹²¹i⁸⁹¹⁰¹²²¹ Verginius Rufus,⁴was arrested fcrthe remainder

praefectus uerunt Saturni, commissioncr of the

It was not till September, 100, that he attained the consul-
cmul ship, which he held for that month and October,
again with Cornutus for his colleague. Upon
taking office, he delivered in the senate the oration oi thanks
for his nomination by the emperor Trajan, which, revised
‘rue pm ,c and enlarged, has corne down to modern times
gyri under the name oi the Panegyris. This is a

very valuable historical document, as it is the only authority
