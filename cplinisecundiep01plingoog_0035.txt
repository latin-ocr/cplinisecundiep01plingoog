§l ansns

a. The epistolary tenses are seldom used. This is because
the letters are such rather in form than in essence. The
epistolary use is most frequent in the letters to Trajan.
There is an extensive use of the historical present, and
some instances of the present indicative for the future in
protasis.

, Upon the whole, Pliny's use of the tenses cannot be con-
sidered as far from normal.

α. Thc subjunctive of iteration or generalitation in reia
tive sentences:

quocumque ore contulissem, vr. 10. 2.
quotiens . . . intraret, 111. 16. 4.

h. The subjunctive often follows contraquam. Kraut,
ξ 39, says there are ten such cases.

c. Si modo regularly takes the indicative unless crahc
obliqua requires the subjunctive.

d. Quamvis with the subjunctive is used of facts not
merely oi argumentative concessions.

twenty are without at.

In rx. 33. Π occurs the unique instance ci the subjunctive
without ut after opas eat.
