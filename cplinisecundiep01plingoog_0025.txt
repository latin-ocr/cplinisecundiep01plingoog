the class oi informers. His facile disposition enabled him
to get on ¹with Domitian and with Trajan. He
goes to the public gamos, though they bore him
and though he dces not approve of them. He
goes hunting, but does not really care for it, and takes his
writing-tablets along with his hunting-gear. He does not
Ι object to a little indeceney in werse, but in his
Qum· conduct there is no trace of anything impure.
He is nottho only man who has “ admired the
contrast between a strict life and a wauton muse.’' His
denunciatione of the wicked ars so beautifully expressed
that we cannot help feeling that he took a good deal of
satisfaction in the style oi his invective, and that the
iniquity of evil-doers did not malie him really unhappy. It
must have been difficult for him to be stern. When his
support of friends under a cloud was really
brave and unselfish, the complaccncy with
which he tells of it afterward robs it of much of its heroic
flavor.
It is a pity that one so kindly should appear in history
as a persecutor of Christians, but it is evident

of Rousseau, and his elaborate simplicity, come ‹langerously
near provoking a patronizing smile3 yet, when

ffi⁵⁰¹¹3¹³⁰t⁰f we have read all he has to say for himself, we
mosny cannot deny that, with all his weaknesses and
affectationS‚ the rnain stuff of his character is

thoroughly good, and we find ourselvcs able t0 award him
that respect which it would be painful to withhold from a

l man so genial and so attractiva.
