HIS volume, beginning where the author's Ancz'ent History
endS, shows the development of the various forces which the
ancient world had brought together and which had been partially
welded in the empire oi Charlemagne. In time it covers eleven
centuries3 but as much space is given to the last hundred years
as to the preceding thousand.

Beginning with the outbreak oi the momentous French Revo-
lution, the book is remarkablyfu113 for the author believes it wise
to treat with comparative briesness the ephemerai phases of the
Middie Ages in order to gain adequate space sor a full treatment
of the marvellous nineteenth century, and so for an intelligent
introduction to the twentieth.

Moreover, the book is noteworthy in the large share of atten-
tion given to the most recent history. To stop the history of
Europe at 1871 is to stop upon the brinlr of a vast and sudden
change and to leave the pupil in the reatos the world oi today
much sarther than is ordinarily represented by a human lisetime.
Since that date there have been created, through the principles
of democracy and nationality,a new Germany, a new Italy‚a new
and stable French Republic. The origin and groivth of these
principles, their struggle with the divine right monarchies and
final victory, are described in vivid language. To put the student
in touch with the recent movements in politics and in society is
the business of the high school course in history.

Like the author's linrr'ent Horam, the book is amply provided
with suggestions for surther reading, both of contemporary authori-
ties and oi modern writers, with topics for special reports, and, as
occasion requires, with review exercises. The latter part of the
book offers all possible a'iri in numerous suggestions for reports
on the events of to-day.
