over-civilized age had a real taste for the enjoyment of
country scats during a part of the year, and their litera
ture from Catullus on is full of appreciation of
the milder and lovelier aspects of nature. They
delighted in a trim garden or well-kept park,

More than once we find a mention of his ‘hendecasyllabos'
which he appears to regard with a certain amount of indul-
gence, and which he hints, not without a suspicion of glee,
are justa little naughty. One cannot help smiling at the
care taken by so excellent a man to assure us that he was
a wicked follow after all in his lighter momente. He cer-

verses is not one to be deeply deplored. No doubt they
were elever and ingenious, but wholly academie. Even
Cicero, when he tried to write poetry, could only produce
admirable prosody.

Pliny's extant works are the Panegyrio and the two collec-
tions of letters, via: nine books of general· corre-
spondence, and one containing the letters to
Trajan. These last are, in most cases, accompanied by the
emperor's replies. ’ The dates of the several books are dis-
cussed in Appendix I. Suffice it to say here, that the
