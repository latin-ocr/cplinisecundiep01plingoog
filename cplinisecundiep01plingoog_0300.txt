Mommsen infers by a combination of Ep. 29. 2 with Epp. V. 4. 2;

9; 13; VI. band a diploma (Henzen, 6857), concernIng the date of the

consulship 01 Licinius Nepos and AfranIus Dexter, that this book was

issued in the beginning 01 105. Η1 finds it consistent with this date

that Pliny no longer appears 11 praefectos aerarii (Ep. 12), but as a

consular (Epp. 8. t; 17. 3), and receives the augurship (Itp. 8; od

⁴ Trai. 13). All this suits 103 and 104. So does the fact that Trajan is

at Rome, for he returned from the first Dacian war in 102 and went to
the second in 105.

It is inferred from allusions to Afranius Dexter, to Licinius Nepos,

that this book was issued the year after the 4111 (106). The last five
books seem to have appeared in more rapiti succesion than the first
four. This may be inferred from the references to tbe 11111101 Bassus·
and Varenus and to the proconsulate 01 Tiro. The rest 01 the con-
11111101 the book are conststent with its issue in 106. Pliny again
appears as holding an office, and soon 11111 this Cornutus becomes his
colleague by receiving the cura 01 the Vin Aemilia. Trajan is never

spoken 01 as at Rome; 11111 is 1111111111 01 the second Dacian war
(105-106 or 107).
