I have to thank several of my colleagues for valuable
information upon matters which come within the sphere
of their special knowledge, but most cf all the general
editors for their faithful and sympathetic coeperaticn in
all stages of my work. Το them are due, in greater measure
thah they are willing to acknowledge, whatever merits the

book may prove to possess.
