3. He is therefore obliged to consider Epp. cd Trai.8 311119 33311131
the chronological order 111 which 311 1113 other letters 31 the group stand

4. In Ep. VI. 29, where Pliny names the five great cases in which
he had been counsel, that 31 Classicus, with regard to its second main
discussion, is named before that 31 Marius Priscus.

e The expression ante memoriam meam, in Ep. IL 14. 3, and the
general tone 31 that letter mark Pliny as advanced in 1113.

Thus Peter goes through the books in order, finding a number 31
1311313 which seem to him inconsistent with tho chronological arrange-
ment 31 Mommsen, his final conclusion being that we cannot accept
Mommsen’s scheme 31 arrangement-a pinely negative conclusion.

Summing up, 3111 verdict would be as follows: The scheme arranged
by Mommsen commends 113311 in its main features. Certain points
may be considered as insufficiently established, bnt they do not invali-
date 1113 conclusions as 3 whole. Τ113 argument 13 3 constructive one,
in which the different parts, leading to a common object, have cumu-
lativc 13133. Destructive argument is relatively 333131. Conclusions
may be attacked, or even 13131311, and nothing put 111 their place.
Some 31 the objections to Mommsen's positions are undoubtedly 131131-
1111 orunsound, some may be admitted Ι13 be convincing in detail. In
3113 important particidar the case against Mommsen‘s view is very

strongly supported; thetis, 13 the matter 31 the (1313 31 the trial 31

’ Classicus and 311 that is involved therein. We may modify our
acceptance 31 Mommsen’s chronology 13 the extent 31 adopting the
conclusions oi Stobbe and Peter in this respect, while believing it 13
be substantially correct as 3 whole.
